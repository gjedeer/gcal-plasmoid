This plasmoid shows a list of future tasks in Google Calendar (agenda). It's mostly inspired by Android widgets. It differs from other gcal applications because it's not a frame displaying GCal Mobile. It supports arbitrary number of calendars and chances are that it also supports other online calendars as long as they export iCal.
